You can easily get into a circular condition that might cause you some grief.

Be that as it may...here is what you can do.

You will need to rely on a Collection to create the functionality.

So, ComboBox1 (we'll call it - but this is whatever name you have for that ComboBox) will have the following:

  OnChange :  ClearCollect(colComboItems, ComboBox1.SelectedItems)

  DefaultSelectedItems : colComboItems

In your Gallery:

  Items:  colComboItems

  On the Delete Icon:

  OnSelect : Remove(colComboItems, ThisItem); Reset(ComboBox1)

 

The above will give you what you want.
